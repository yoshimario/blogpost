## About my Day
My name is Sean and my day is going well as I have now started my new bootcamp program with **Epicodus**. I am looking forward to getting into the programming world and am also finishing my last few weeks of my _Associates of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking_. I have two classes left in my degree which will end this summer and am looking forwad to this second degree. I already have a _Bachelors of Arts in Digital Cinema and Videogame Design_. 
### My Favorite Foods
I have many favorite foods but the one that I enjoy the most would have to be a Blueberry Cheesecake. The flavor combination is a perfect bliss of luxury and delight. Another food that was my favorite is a _Korvapuusti_ (Finnish Cinnnamon Roll). I found out the secret to this cinnamon roll was Cardamom that made the flavor so good and I acutally made my first batch a couple weeks ago.
