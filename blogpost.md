## About my Day
My name is Sean and my day is going well as I have now started my new bootcamp program with **Epicodus**. I am looking forward to getting into the programming world and am also finishing my last few weeks of my _Associates of Science in Cybersecurity and Networking_. I have two classes left in my degree which will end this summer and am looking forwad to this second degree. I already have a _Bachelors of Arts in Digital Cinema and Videogame Design_.  

### My Favorite Foods
I have many favorite foods but the one that I enjoy the most would have to be a Blueberry Cheesecake. The flavor combination is a perfect bliss of luxury and delight. Another food that was my favorite is a _Korvapuusti_ (Finnish Cinnnamon Roll). I found out the secret to this cinnamon roll was Cardamom that made the flavor so good and I actually made my first batch a couple weeks ago.
#### My Favorite Vacation Destinations
I have been to many countries and really miss the ability to tavel and hoping that one day the pandemic will finnally allow for travel soon. Last year I visited many countries I fell in love with. 

1. Finland: This was my first country that I visited in the _Scandanavian_ region in July 2019. I loved it so much that I had went back in late October of the same year. The culture was amazing and the scenery was one of my favorite things. Also the colder weather and less daylight was another part I enjoyed. Some photos that I have taken in Finland can be found here https://seanpwilson.com/media/photography/travels/finland-2019/.
2. Sweden: Another wonderful country was Sweden though I only got to see it for one day as I took an overnight ferry from Helsinki, Finland to Stockholm, Sweden for a day trip.
3. Iceland: Iceland was an amazing country that is extremely photogenic.
